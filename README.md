## "Hidden" pages

Pages that are sometimes hard to find because they're either not talked about a lot or there's no link to them from the official sites, but they exist!


| Page Name | Description | Link |
| - | - | - |
| Automation workshops | If you want to see how Composer or RPA look like, but you have no access to them yet, you can join these workshops to get a better feeling of the products | https://training.mulesoft.com/workshops/automation-workshops
| Another Integration Blog in Medium | Led by the community team at MuleSoft, but all content is created by the actual community. Here you can find more technical content than in the official MuleSoft Blog | https://medium.com/another-integration-blog
| DataWeave questions in StackOverflow | Apart from the MuleSoft forums (or the help center), the DataWeave team likes to keep any transformation-specific questions in StackOverflow because of its wider visibility. Use this channel if you have specific transformations you need help with. | https://stackoverflow.com/tags/dataweave
